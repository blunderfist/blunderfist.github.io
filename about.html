			<h2>About my portfolio</h2>
				<div class="text_bg">
				<p>I'm currently learning a variety of computer skills with courses on Coursera and will be attending college this fall to obtain a certificate in Big Data/Data Analytics. Coursera has been great at giving me access to introductory programming courses and providing a good way to lay the ground work that will help me as I move into more applying these skills in a data analyst postition.</p>
				<p>This website is the final project from University of Michigan's Web Development for Everybody specialization on Coursera. The specialization consists of introductory courses on HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and Responsive Design. At the end of the course students are expected to put it all together and showcase what they have learned. This site was built using HTML from scratch and using Bootstrap for most of the CSS and all of the JavaScript. I added a little CSS to tweak a few minor things. It's basic but I felt it was more interesting to showcase skills on a website I built myself than just linking to a Github account or one of the other e-portfolio sites out there. Speaking of which I have an e-portfolio on <a href="https://portfolium.com/matthewthompso67">Portfolium</a> which has more of the typical college work to showcase.</p>
				<p>The main takeaways from learning front end web development were to make web pages accessible and use proper semantics. Neither of those issues had ever even occured to me prior to taking these courses, and I think it is great that the web is being built in such a way that everyone can have the best experience possible regardless of any phyiscal limitations. I did my best to follow these practices and had the website validated on <a href="https://validator.w3.org">W3 Validator</a>. Note that if you want to validate this site yourself you'll need to copy and paste the source into the validator. For some reason just using the address returns a different page warning about JavaScript and is not this actual site.</p>
